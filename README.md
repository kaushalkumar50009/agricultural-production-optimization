# Agricultural Production Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing agricultural production through data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance yield prediction, resource management, and crop selection to improve overall agricultural efficiency.

## Features

- **Yield Prediction**: Predict crop yields based on various factors such as weather, soil conditions, and historical data.
- **Resource Management**: Optimize the use of resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides.
- **Crop Selection**: Recommend the best crops to plant based on environmental conditions and market demand.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikash029/agricultural-production-optimization.git
   cd agricultural-production-optimization
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   Ensure that you have the required datasets. Place them in the `data/` directory or specify their path in the configuration files.

2. **Run the main script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will execute the core functionalities of the project. Adjust parameters as needed through the configuration files or command-line arguments.

## Configuration

Configuration settings are available in the `config/` directory. You can modify these settings to adapt the project to different datasets or optimization criteria.
